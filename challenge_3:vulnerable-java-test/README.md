<h1>Challenge 3: Vulnerable Java Test</h1>
The goal of this challenge is to assess if you can implement the standard application security defence techniques.

The repo contains a file that only has a 3 samples of java code.

The code contained within each snippet is vulnerable to a specific form of attack. This attack has a secure codeing defence mechanism that is common accross most languages.
Apply the defensive mechanism to the snippet. Do this and the challenge is complete.

Note: This code is not designed to be run, there is no requirement to add this to any sort of java class and run it.
